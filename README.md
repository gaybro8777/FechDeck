# FechDeck
A handtool for exploring psychophysics

The FechDeck is an ordinary deck of playing cards that has been designed to support hands-on learning of psychophysical methods. Card backs are printed with noise patterns that span a range of densities. Faces are augmented with line segments arranged in “L” patterns. Jokers are printed with ruled faces and with backs that serve as noise standards. Instructions provided with the FechDeck allows users to perform threshold experiments using Fechner’s methods of adjustment, limits, and constant stimuli, and scaling experiments using Thurstone’s ranking, pair comparison, and successive categories methods, and Stevens’s magnitude estimation method. Spreadsheets provided with the deck support easy data entry and meaningful data analysis.
